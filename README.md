## Web2Print CCA 2022

### Course description
The browser allows designers to create truly trans-media works by drawing from the same content to produce both digital and printed products. This course will use the browser to investigate systems and algorithms in graphic design in both digital and analog ways. The browser, in its mutability and its fraught relationship to form, will be used as a vehicle to interrogate and innovate layout techniques, typesetting, hierarchy, and visual form. Students will build skills in HTML, CSS, & Javascript as well as learn print production techniques in this analog-digital hybrid course.
